    <h1>Jon Leos</h1>
        <h2> Interest</h2>
        <p>My Goal in my career is to continue to make programs with my own hands. Something that I can show to my family and say "I did that". In this course it looks like I will be able to continue in my studies of programming and hopefully look at learning a new language doing so. I know it might be something simple like a refresher on HTML but sometimes going back to the basics is something that can be helpful, allows someone to look at what they have been doing and finding out a different way to do it better, faster, more efficient.</p>
        <p>Something I really want to do it network with others who are also learning at the same time as me. What better way to get help then from people who are looking at starting something in school. People with common interests, or colleuges who are looking to do the same type of work as me. </p>
