# Project Scope Statement 
## Propject Name: RetroFlux hub
### Project Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to help people with their Vintage Video Game Collections. Whether your goal is to complete it, start it, or show it off. 

### Feedback Loops: 
 I will need feedback from 3 groups of people. The Traders, The Consumers, and The techs who will be verifying everything. Since those are the 3 most important aspects of the program and communities. 

### Description: 
I would like to decribe it as something that is close to Ebay, or PriceCharting where people can look at something and reach out to find out more about it, or to show it off. 

### People Resources:
The Key Memebers of this project would be the people verifying everything. These are the people who will help us standout from everyone else. 

### Desired Result: 
The desired result is to have at least 100 people make a account. Anything less, then there is no point, With 100 people we can look on getting better feedback, be able to network and use word of mouth. 

### Priorites:
#### Time:
I would like to have this project done by the end of the year. That gives me enough time to work on the Front and Back end, UI (User Interface), Design, and figure out everything I need to do for the human part of this project. 
#### Quality:
Done will be when you can open up the site, make a profile, and start putting in and uploading your collections. Making sure everything can have a price tag on it from the last sold on ebay. People able to talk to eachother, and start sending things to be be verified, and ship to the consumer with little or no delayed for anything. 
#### Budget: 
The budget is a little flexible. Most of this project is going to be crated by me. Where I dont have to pay myself. The tricky part is finding out how to set a percentage to pay the people verifying eveything. How much can come to me (as the creator), and how much can go to them. If I can get some seed money, then it might be able to work out a little faster, with being able to get some help with the code side of things, as well as putting something to the side for people to get paid to verify things. 

### Exclusions: 
At the current moment, I feel that moving forward with a TCG cards might be a little out of reach. I was hoping to add it, but it takes a different type of person to really look into the cards and make sure they are as advertise. Not saying something like a PSA slab can not be done, but I feel like we should stay away from this for a while. 

### Aceptance Criteria: 
As soon as I can get this project up and running there really is not anyone who would need to sign off on it except for me. Now if I am able to get a stakeholder, who would like to look into this project with me then making sure they are happy before launch as well as me being happy, but since I am working on 90% of this project, I really fell like the only one who can say "done" is me, with how I imagined this site to look.
