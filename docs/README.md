# RetroFlux Hub

<p>
Welcome to RetroFlux, where you can make your Gaming/Console trades easier. If you are a collector, you are like me someone who has a great video game console collector, but there is still something or another that you are looking for to finishing your collection. Maybe you are trying to get that nostalgic feeling and start your collection from the bottom up. Maybe you want to "Flex" it. Well look no further, we are here to help. The difference between us and any other collection is we are 100% going to be trade base. Money transactions can still happen but we want to make sure that a trade can be as easy as possible. Where the trades you make are not only wanted by you and your partner, but vetted and authenticated by a specialist on our side. To make sure every trade is honored 100% and each party is getting exactly what is wanted. Helping with Scams, and Bots.
