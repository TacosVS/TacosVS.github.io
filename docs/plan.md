# Plan
So this is the plan page where I  will plan out everything to make the project a reality. 

With any type of project there is a number of different things you need to look at, starting with the risk assesment. 



|  | Risk | Impact | Probability  | Score  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
1| Tracking | 5 | 3 | 15 |
2| Shipping | 3 | 4 | 12 |
3| Hiring | 2 | 1 | 2|
4| Loss Prevention | 5 | 4 | 20
5| Account Security| 3 | 2| 6
6| Time | 4 | 3| 12 

So the main issue I have is with tracking inventory, and loss prevention. The reason loss prevention is so high is because I am looking at hiring people from all over to help with the being able to check the devices that are being traded. 

|  | Risk | Score | Strategy  | Who  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
1| Tracking | 15 | I have some ideas to help with tracking and help show who is getting what. I will also like to have mail boxes set up in local techs area so they can pick up devices | Jon |
2| Shipping | 12 | Well need to see who has the best insurance and times that can ship items and see what USPS FedEx or UPS has to offer | Jon  |
3| Loss Prevention | 20 | With the tracking app I am looking at making, I should be able to hold people accountable for item they have.  | Jon 
4| Time | 12 | This one is hard to really manage, since we would be working with extra delivery on verify trades which will be sent to be verified before getting sent to the customer.  | Jon
