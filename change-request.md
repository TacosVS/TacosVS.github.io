# Project Change request 
## Project Name: RetroFlux Hub 
## Request By: Some Stakeholder 
### Proposed Change:
<p> I would like to see this project with more then just consoles. I would like to work with games as well, maybe even being able to trade vintage cards for Magic TCG, Yu-Gi-Oh, or pokemon.

### Reasons for the Change: 
<p> So the reason for this change is so that we can compete with these other applications and companies that are already doing this. Yet, they are from seller to buyer with no one in the middle to verify what people are actually getting, which makes this change something like a trade verification to make sure the possiblity of scams cant interfere with the transactions. 

### How This Change will Add Value: 
<p> The benefit means if we can add this and actually able to save peoples transaction to make sure that there is no issues with any trade on this platform. Not only does it add profit to open up to different types of markets. Also able to add value to this program over anyone or anything already doing this. 

### How this Change will Affect the Constraints: 
<p> I dont see this affecting budget, but time and quality might take a great hit, With more types of items, there is a chance something might slip though the gaps. Something might take longer do to a set number of people being able to work on the verification process.
